# Multivariate-Analysis
Multivariate Analysis Project for the course (Applied Mathematics and Computer Science)

### Description

1. Find a labeled dataset that you have interest in its analysis. In this project it was chosen the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
2. Make a preliminary analysis of the data and discuss what you have learned from this analysis.
3. Solve your classification problem using supervised learning methods. Have in mind that some of
the input variables may be irrelevant to the classification problem and that you may need to do
some preprocessing methodologies of your data set e.g. dimensionality reduction techniques.
4. Apply unsupervised methods to your data. Interpret the results. Compare the obtained partitions
with the true class each object belongs to.
5. Repeat the classification study using for classes the partition clusters obtained in (4). Compare
the results with the ones obtained in 3. Discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of each
strategy. Which would you recommend to analyze your dataset?
Include in your discussion all options that you have made, advantages and disadvantages of each
alternative.
6. Imagine you are going to meet the researcher who contacted you. Report to him/her what you
have learned about the problem. Discuss limitations of the analysis you have done and provide
suggestions for future work.
